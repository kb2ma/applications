# nanocoap Block Test App
Provides a CLI based tool for interactive or scripted testing of a nanocoap
client that uses the block extension. Top level commands are listed below.
To see command syntax, enter the command with no other text (for example, 
just "client").

We already have server side block implementations in nanocoap_server
example.

## *control*
Tests block2 control usage. GETs /riot/ver from nanocoap_server example.

## *descrip*
Tests block1 descriptive usage. POSTs /sha256 to nanocoap_server example.

## *inet6*
Lists IPv6 address for each network interface. This listing is helpful for tap
based testing, where the link local address is generated by the operating system.
